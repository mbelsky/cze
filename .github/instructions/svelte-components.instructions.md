## Svelte Component Guidelines

- Use Svelte 5 runes syntax ($state, $derived, $effect) instead of legacy reactive declarations
- Components use plain JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- Keep components focused and small
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible
- Support both light and dark mode via CSS custom properties
